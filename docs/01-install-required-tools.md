# Install Required Tools

To prepare for your instalation, make sure you have all required command-line
utilities installed. If you are on a Mac (or if you use Linnx Brew) you can
install them using the provided `Brewfile`.

```bash
brew bundle install
```

To make things a bit simpler, there's also a target in the `Makefile` that will
install themi for you.

```bash
make brew
```
